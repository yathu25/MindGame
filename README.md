# MindGame
A simple pair card mind game to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation. 

Plans to turn it into a full-stack game application.

In each turn, the player clicks on a tile to reveal the picture associated with this tile.
If the player finds a matching pair in two consecutive turns, the pair will be marked as known.
Otherwise, the two tiles will be hidden again. The game continues until all pairs are exposed.


TASKS DONE:
*CREATE HTML BLOCKS
*CSS FOR REVEALING TILE COLOR
*IMPLEMENT LOGIC TO RANDOMIZE TILE POSITIONING AT EVERY ROUND


TO DO:
*CREATE BACKEND FOR SCOREBOARD AND LEADER BOARD
*IMPROVE STYLING 

FUTURE PLANS:
*ADD TIMER
*FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN ADD SOUND AND ANNIMATIONS
